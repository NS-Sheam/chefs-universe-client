        "question": "How to validate React props using PropTypes?",
        "answer": "In React, PropTypes is a library that provides a way to specify the types of props that a component should receive. This helps to ensure that the correct types of props are passed to a component, which can help prevent errors and make debugging easier. To use PropTypes, wefirst need to import it from the 'prop-types' package.Then, you can define the PropTypes for your component by adding a propTypes property to the component.The propTypes are defined as an object with keys that correspond to the names of the props that the component expects. The values of the propTypes are PropTypes objects that specify the type of each prop."
